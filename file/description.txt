Hello, I'm Charlotte Chen, a senior double majoring in Computer Science and Economics at the University of Pittsburgh. Since I was young, I have loved to create and draw comic stories of my own, and when I was exposed to computer applications, I self-taught myself to make my comics into cartoons using Powerpoint and eventually Flash. With an equal passion for computer and art, I declared my major in computer science in college with special focus in web application and UI development. I found developing to be extremely similar to drawing; you start with a blank sheet of paper and the possibilties are limitless. The potential of creating something great constantly motivates me to develop and design more applications with clean and beautiful interfaces.
