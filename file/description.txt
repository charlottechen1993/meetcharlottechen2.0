Hello, I'm Charlotte Chen, a recent graduate of the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Computer Sciences and in Economics. 

Since I was little, I have loved to draw comic stories. Eventually I was exposed to computer softwares, and I began to turn my comics into animation cartoons using Powerpoint and eventually Flash. With an equal passion for computer and art, I declared my major in computer science with special focus in web application and UI development. 

The idea of developing is same to drawing: you start with a blank space and the possibilities are limitless. The potential of creating something great constantly motivates me to develop more applications with beautiful and functional interfaces.
